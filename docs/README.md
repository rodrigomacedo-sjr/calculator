# Planning

Numbers and operator may be set with a function. Useful for checking erros and status.

# Insights

The current logic envolving operators and utils does not seem right. Hard values in the current way. \
I want to find a better way to deal with this. \

Wow I really wish I had unit tests here. Would make it all way easier.
