# Planning

Numbers and operator may be set with a function. Useful for checking erros and status.

# Insights

The current logic envolving operators and utils does not seem right. Hard values in the current way. \
I want to find a better way to deal with this. 

Wow I really wish I had unit tests here. Would make it all way easier. \

Favorite development bug: \
![Shows a broken calculator app, With overflowing text with lots of 'NaN's in the display.](bug.png "Favorite bug")
